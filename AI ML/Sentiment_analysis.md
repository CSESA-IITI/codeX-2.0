# üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Problem Statement: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis for a Virtual Counsellor

## üéØ Objective

Build an AI-powered **virtual counsellor** that can analyze both **text** (what someone says) and **video** (how they express it) to detect sentiment and emotions. The system leverages multimodal learning to answer:

> ‚ÄúWhat is this person *really* feeling, based on both their words and expressions?‚Äù

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

* **Text Sentiment Analysis:**
  Use transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) to classify emotions from chat/text.

* **Video Emotion Recognition:**
  Extract frames with OpenCV, analyze facial expressions with pre-trained CNN models (FER+, AffectNet, or `deepface`).

* **Multimodal Fusion:**
  Combine predictions from text and video channels (early fusion = merge features; late fusion = combine model outputs).

* **Virtual Counsellor Agent:**
  Provide empathetic, context-aware feedback like:
  *‚ÄúI notice you seem stressed. Want me to share a relaxation tip?‚Äù*

## üíª Tech Stack & Concepts

* **Python Libraries:** HuggingFace Transformers, OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow, DeepFace/FER
* **Concepts:** Sentiment analysis, facial emotion recognition, multimodal fusion, human-centered AI

## üöÄ Extensions

* **Speech Analysis:** Add audio sentiment (tone, pitch, intensity).
* **RAG Integration:** Retrieve mental health tips or motivational responses.
* **Interactive App:** Deploy with Streamlit or Gradio as a real-time counsellor UI.
* **Privacy-Aware:** Add anonymization features for ethical use.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Difficulty Note:**
This is *Advanced* because it requires:

1. Handling **two modalities** (text + video).
2. Designing a **fusion strategy**.
3. Deploying it in a usable, stable form.
