# üé¨ Problem Statement: Content-Based Movie Recommendation System
## üéØ Objective
 Build a Content-Based Movie Recommendation Engine in Python that suggests movies similar to a given title based on genre, plot, cast, and crew. The system leverages text processing and similarity measures to answer:
  > ‚ÄúIf you liked movie X, you may also like movie Y.‚Äù

  ## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features
   - **Data Preprocessing:** Load, clean, and normalize datasets such as MovieLens or TMDB, handling missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicates. 
   - **Feature Engineering:** Create a unified text representation (‚Äúcontent soup‚Äù) by combining genres, keywords, cast, crew, and movie descriptions into a single feature per movie. - **Vectorization:** 
   - **Core / Beginner:** Use classical NLP vectorization techniques like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words with Scikit-learn. 
   - **Extensions / Advanced:** Use semantic embeddings via transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) or sentence embeddings using sentence-transformers. 
   - **Similarity Measure:** - **Core / Beginner:** Compute Cosine Similarity between TF-IDF / BoW vectors. 
   - **Extensions / Advanced:** Compute similarity between embeddings using Cosine Similarity. 
   - **Recommendation Function:** Given a movie title, return the Top-N most similar movies based on the chosen vectorization and similarity pipeline.

## üöÄ Extensions 
- Launch an interactive app using Gradio or Streamlit for movie recommendations. 
- Explore Collaborative Filtering and hybrid recommender models. 
- Incorporate additional features (ratings, release year, budget) into similarity calculations.
