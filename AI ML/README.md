# AI/ML

Welcome to the codeË£ repo of the most fascinating domain of them all. How does ChatGPT understand your assignment? how does gemini makes a photo of you in a Bugatti? And why is stockfish unbeatable? The answer to all this is what we refer to as Artificial intelligience. 

Since we are expecting beginners(as in, we don't expect you to know much, except python), so we have compiled a list of resources you can use to break your way into this domain. 

## Resources

- [Kaggle Learn - Courses on the topic](https://www.kaggle.com/learn): Slow but steady
- [3B1B - Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi): First 4 videos are enough. Can continue for interest. 
- [Patrick Loeber - Pytorch](https://youtu.be/c36lUUr864M?si=rGPrz-aWPjTHlYRL): The researcher's favorite framework.
- [Aladdin Persson - TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxVOdVC1P1L5z5azs0XjMsb): Google's own framework
- [Murtaza's Workshop - OpenCV](https://youtu.be/WQeoO7MI0Bs?si=UrVALxkKLFfq0sDM): half of the fancy Computer Vision projects you see on the internet.
- [CS 229](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&feature=shared), [CS 230](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOABXSygHTsbvUz4G_YQhOb&feature=shared), [CS 231](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&feature=shared): Stanford Courses; Beloved.
- [CampusX - 100 days of Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH&si=gNvEs14B5n-UXJOm): More oriented towards classical ML. Completely optional but handy. 
- [CampusX - 100 days of Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn): Highly detailed, but long. Again optional.

Yes, there really is no end. 

"There must be some other way to learn than just endless cycle of videos?" 

Well, there is...
