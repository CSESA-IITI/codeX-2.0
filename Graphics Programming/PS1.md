# PS1 â€“ Turing Robot (Easy)

Create a game that visually replicates the working of a **Turing Machine**.

**Objectives:**

- Player is given a finite segment of an infinite tape and a robot at a starting position.
- They must analyze the tape and design an algorithm to solve it and unlock the next level.
- Provide a **drag-and-drop interface** from a fixed/minimal set of moves to build algorithms.
- The game should reflect the working of a Turing Machine while being fun to play.
