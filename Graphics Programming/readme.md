# Graphics Programming & Game Development

This section is designed to expose you to the world of **Graphics Programming** and **Game Development**.  
Each problem statement (PS) is designed to teach you a new concept. Hope you have fun working on them!

## Problem Statements

> You can use any engine of your choice for these projects.  
> If you are unsure, go with **Unity** for 2D & 3D, or **Unreal Engine** for 3D.

---

### 1. Turing Robot (Easy)
Create a game that visually replicates the working of a **Turing Machine**.  
- Player is given a finite segment of an infinite tape and a robot at a starting position.  
- They must analyze the tape and design an algorithm to solve it and unlock the next level.  
- You may provide a **drag-and-drop interface** from a fixed/minimal set of moves to build algorithms. 
- The game should reflect the working of a Turing Machine while being fun to play.  

---

### 2. Shaders that React to Sound (Easy)
Create an **Audio-Reactive Shader** and use it inside a game.  
- The game itself can be simple, but the shader should be **visually impressive**.  
- The main judging criteria is **how visually pleasing the shaders look**.  

---

### 3. Time-Rewind Platformer (Easy – Intermediate)
Create a platformer with a **time rewind mechanic**.  
- The player can reverse time for the environment (objects return to previous states) while the player remains unaffected.  
- Example:  
  - Push a box into a pit to cross.  
  - After crossing, rewind time to bring the box back.  
  - Use the box to jump a wall.  
- Levels should be **designed around creative use of the rewind mechanic**.  


---

### 4. Detective / Mystery RPG (Easy – Intermediate)
Build a simple RPG that takes place in **one room**.  
- The room contains **clues and hidden items** the player can interact with.  
- Correct interaction sequence cracks the case/mystery.  
- Multiple levels can be created with increasing difficulty.  
- Focus on **engaging storylines** and **challenging puzzles**.

---

### 5. Autonomous Behaviour / Movement (Intermediate)
Design an AI with **autonomous movement** in 2D or 3D.  
- AI should have behaviours like:  
  - Wandering  
  - Chasing the player  
  - Running away  
  - Obstacle avoidance  
- Movement should feel **smooth and natural**.  
- You may use **Pathfinding, Steering Behaviours, Context-Based Steering**, or a hybrid approach.  

---

### 6. IITI Horror Game (Advanced)
Build a **3D horror/zombie survival game** set inside IITI campus.  
- Choose a section (e.g., CVR hostel, or surrounding area).  
- Game can take place entirely indoors or include outdoor areas.  
- You are free to design mechanics (exploration, survival, escape, combat).  
- Focus on **atmosphere, tension, and immersion**.
