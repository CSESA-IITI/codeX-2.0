# PS3 – Time-Rewind Platformer (Easy – Intermediate)

Create a platformer with a **time rewind mechanic**.

**Objectives:**

- The player can reverse time for the environment (objects return to previous states) while the player remains unaffected.
- Example:
  - Push a box into a pit to cross.
  - After crossing, rewind time to bring the box back.
  - Use the box to jump a wall.
- Levels should be **designed around creative use of the rewind mechanic**.
