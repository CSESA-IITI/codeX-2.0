# Quantum Computing Resources

Most of the resources provided to you will be documents or code repositories, as there aren't many excellent learning resources in video format.

## Pre-requisites

You will be required to have at least some basic understanding of Quantum Mechanics before attempting to research and learn about these algorithms. (hope you were paying attention in physics lectures :) ).  

- [Quantum Sense Channel (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@quantumsensechannel) – An amazing channel which explains quantum mechanics in an easy way.  

You will also require some elementary knowledge of Python itself, as it is the primary programming language used for Quantum Computing.  

- [Learn Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) – Learn python basics.

Probably the best resource to learn Qiskit is the IBM docs.  

- [IBM Quantum Docs](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides) – Official guides for Qiskit.
