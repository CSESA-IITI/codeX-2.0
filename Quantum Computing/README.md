# Quantum Computing

This section is mostly focused on learning, as many of you would not be familiar with quantum computing.  
For this section we will explicitly use Python, specifically **Qiskit**, which is a Python library for Quantum Computing.  

Quantum Computing has a higher barrier of entry in general because of a steep learning curve & lack of many easily readable resources.  
For this reason a difficult problem is not included. It is highly advised to solve both problems, as once you start to get the hang of Quantum Computing, both problems become decently easy.
