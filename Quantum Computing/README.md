# Quantum Computing

This section is mostly focused on learning, as many of you may not be familiar with quantum computing.  
We will explicitly use Python, specifically **Qiskit**, which is a Python library for Quantum Computing.  

Quantum Computing has a higher barrier of entry due to a steep learning curve and limited beginner-friendly resources.  
For this reason, only two problem statements are included, which are famous Quantum Computing algorithms.
