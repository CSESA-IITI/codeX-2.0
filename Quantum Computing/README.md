# Quantum Computing

This section is mostly focused on learning, as many of you would not be familiar with quantum computing in general.  
For this section we will explicitly use Python, specifically we will be using **Qiskit**, a Python library for Quantum Computing.  

Quantum Computing has a higher barrier of entry in general because of a steep learning curve & lack of many easily readable resources.  
For this reason a difficult problem is not included. It is highly advised to solve both problems, as once you start to get the hang of Quantum Computing, both problems become decently easy.  

We will try to simplify that by giving you 2 very famous Quantum Computing algorithms to implement as the problem statements.
