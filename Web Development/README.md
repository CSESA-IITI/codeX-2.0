# Web Development

Many people think Web Development is just building websites or using Figma, but it's much more than that. Web Development teaches you how most applications work, even in domains like AI, Edge Devices, and Embedded Systems. It would help you for leading them to production. Concepts like **scaling, caching, load balancing, serverless architectures**, and various frameworks are learned here, helping you across almost every tech domain.

But as every big task starts with small steps. Here, we are **not going to spread more chaos**, but keep things **approachable and fun**, with a touch of our college club's vibes. We'll provide resources and guidance to help you start your journey smoothly.

Yeah, we know there are a lot of resources but we think anybody can just search videos and learn from one they resonate with or official documentation.  
FreeCodeCamp, Apna College, CodewithHarry, CodewithChai, Coding Ninja are some popular channels.
