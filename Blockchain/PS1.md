# PS1 â€“ Decentralised Lottery System (Easy)

Design a smart contract for a decentralized lottery application on the blockchain. Participants can join by paying a fixed fee within a specified timeframe.  

The smart contract employs cryptographic randomness to impartially select a winner. Winnings are automatically transferred to the winner's address using the blockchain's transparent and trustless nature. The contract ensures that participants cannot enter more than once, ensuring fairness.

**Key Features:**

- Participants can join the lottery by sending the specified amount of ETH only.
- The lottery operates within specific start and end times.
- Winner is determined through a secure randomness method.
- Once the lottery concludes, all accumulated funds are promptly transferred to the winner's address.

**Note:** Write the code on Remix IDE in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain.
