# Beginner's Guide to Competitive Programming

This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with competitive programming.  
It provides a carefully selected set of beginner-friendly Codeforces problems to practice logic and implementation skills, along with a collection of learning resources (courses, books, and problem sets) to build a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.

## Structure of This Domain

- [RESOURCES.md](./RESOURCES.md) – curated learning resources  

### Problem Sets

- [PS1 – Implementation & Simulation](./PS1.md)  
  Problems that test your ability to translate rules directly into code.

- [PS2 – Greedy & Sorting](./PS2.md)  
  Problems that require sorting and greedy strategies.

- [PS3 – Basic Math & Number Theory](./PS3.md)  
  Problems based on divisibility, prime factors, parity, and algebraic reasoning.

- [PS4 – Constructive & Ad-Hoc Logic](./PS4.md)  
  Problems requiring creative thinking and construction of valid solutions.

Start with the resources, then solve the problem sets in order.
