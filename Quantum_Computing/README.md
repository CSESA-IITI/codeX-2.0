# Quantum Computing

This section is mostly focused on learning, as many of you would not be familiar with quantum computing in general.  
For this section we will explicitly use python, specifically we will be using QisKit which is a python library for Quantum Computing.  

Quantum Computing has a higher barrier of entry in general because of a steep learning curve & lack of many easily readable resources.  
For this reason a difficult problem is not included as such a problem will not allow for much understanding of quantum computing.  
We will try to simplify that by giving you 2 very famous Quantum Computing algorithms to implement as the problem statements.  

Most of the resources provided to you will be documents or code repositories, as there aren't many excellent learning resources in video format.  

## Pre-requisites

You will be required to have at least some basic understanding of Quantum Mechanics before attempting to research and learn about these algorithms  
(hope you were paying attention in physics lectures :) ). A good resource that also helped me in my physics course is:  
- An amazing channel which explains quantum mechanics in an easy way - [https://www.youtube.com/@quantumsensechannel](https://www.youtube.com/@quantumsensechannel)  

You will also require some elementary knowledge of python itself, as it is the primary programming language used for Quantum Computing.  
- Learn python - [https://www.w3schools.com/python/](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)  

Probably the best resource to learn qiskit is the IBM docs.  
- The Docs - [https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides)  

## Problem Statement 1 - BB84, A Quantum Encryption Algorithm (Easy)

- Some reference code for you - [https://codeocean.com/capsule/8352553/tree/v1](https://codeocean.com/capsule/8352553/tree/v1)  
- A Decent Video for you to understand BB84 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3WzH2up7Os](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3WzH2up7Os)  

## Problem Statement 2 - Grover's Algorithm (Intermediate)

- Some Light Quantum Mechanics - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4)  
- 3B1B Video of Grover's Algorithm - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU)  
- A Grover's Algorithm Tutorial for Qiskit - [https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials/grovers-algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials/grovers-algorithm)  
- Another great resource for understanding implementation of Grover's Algorithm - [https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/ch-algorithms/grover.ipynb](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/ch-algorithms/grover.ipynb)
